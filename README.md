# Final-Project-Purwadhika-JCDS-08
Final Project for Job Connector Data Science Program at Purwadhika Digital School.

This data was extracted from the 1994 Census United States bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker (Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics). This dataset task is to determine accurately whether a person makes over $50K a year or not.
You can access the dataset from this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income">link.</a>


This is Classification task. In this project, I will use 4 models(Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier). With each model, I will be performing Hyperparameter Tuning.
